No dependencies, just main mod

Yes
- Extrablocks
- Mythic Metals
- Repurposed Structures
- Structory
- Terra
- Towns and Towers
- Yung's Mineshafts, Ocean monuments, witch huts, bridges and dungeons?
- Artifacts: maybe add or remove some artifacts. I assume this can be done by yoinking their source code and building it ourselves without those things added to loot tables. or editing the jar perhaps.
- Better Combat
- Create and submods
- Farmer's Delight and submods
- All decorative mods should have no issues
- Carry On
- Disenchanter
- Snad
- Blue's serverside optimization mods


Maybe??
- simply swords. while cool (really) I feel it adds too much? like this would be great for a massive modpack with actually challenging enemies but if we add this I feel we have to add that too and that will just snowball
- heartstone: doesn't add much
- We gotta take a look at quark

Unfortunately not:
- bunch of mods are forge only :bwomp:
- serene seasons and rotten creatures are outdated
- while I love the idea of immersive weathering, it somehow fucks with terra terrain gen and turns entire biomes into permafrost (which would be fine if it wasn't literally completely useless and also it just looks less great etc etc.  terra good)

Mods that we kinda probably still need: ocean monuments. I still gotta test this but it has complained multiple times that it can't generate some parts and I don't want that causing crashes

more enemies/stronger enemies. I was kinda banking on rotten creatures to update but no

dungeons: we can just use yungs again but there have to be other ones out there right??
even more enemies: I really wanna justify simplyswords, even though mythic metals will most likely have enough variation on its own
gonna watch some videos on them hopefully we got some results :pray:

dungeons and taverns seems to do a good job of dungeons: the only issue is large parts of structures being filled up and some being too large for terra generation
update: it has to be this one for me. really cool structures, semi-questlines and a good chunk of exploration. love love love this one. structures kan generate fucked but I think the scale of the big ones kinda makes that okay? ask for examples or smthn. Issue: the loot tables are fucked up bad. Solution: is datapack so just. unjar the jar, change files, rejar the jar? possible? idk but hopeful. see if we can change artifacts and mythic metals to include their loot tables into that without having to do that ourselves, I think artifacts injects some loot tables. idk if we can mess with that or if that even is what that does but whatever. 
mythic metals especially good for this, since rare upgrades can be put in chests for bigger dungeons. riches for easier ones, good strong powerful reward for others. 


Don't really feel like adding individual files anymore so :
[AdventureZ](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/adventurez) more bosses, enemies, creatures, etc etc etc etc. really cool, works with betterend and any nether changes I think. 

Endless biomes is not compatible, so I opted for [Better End](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/betterend/files/4971487). Solid, adds a few new structures and just makes the end look really nice

Animal mods are a bit meh imo, I added [More Mob Variants](https://modrinth.com/mod/more-mob-variants/version/1.2.2)

[Nyf's Spiders](https://modrinth.com/mod/nyfs-spiders/version/cmqFoINR) funny
