==We can probably add some extra biomes with modded blocks that should be doable. this is also fine tbh==

==Also maybe add a more basic cherry grove biome: that seems to be lacking at the  moment, with only cherry grove mountains that aren't massive. It should be very doable to make a basic cherry forest since I know those are popular==
