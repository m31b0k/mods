Terra is a modern world generation modding platform that allows complete customization of world generation with an advanced API, tightly integrated with a powerful configuration system.


==We can probably add some extra biomes with modded blocks that should be doable. this is also fine tbh==

==Also maybe add a more basic cherry grove biome: that seems to be lacking at the  moment, with only cherry grove mountains that aren't massive. It should be very doable to make a basic cherry forest since I know those are popular==
### Compatibility

Check: 
[[Integrated Stronghold]]
[[Repurposed Structures]] 
[[Towns and Towers]]
[[Waystones]]? Should technically be fine as it generates inside villages or is an item? <- figure out what to do with this mod lol
[[Yung's]] - 
Everything. since it replaces vanilla structures it should be fine? maybe doublecheck some because the footprint of a lot of these are larger than vanilla and that will cause weird floating structures. underground things should be fine. things like the jungle temple, less so
[[Immersive Weathering]]


Compatible:
[[Mythic Metals]]
